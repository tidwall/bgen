- Allow for sane customizations and options
- Make it possible to use one btree library for a variety of collection types,
  such as maps, sets, stacks, queues, lists, vectors, and spatial indexes. 
  See the [examples](examples).

It's a non-goal for bgen to provide disk-based functionality or a B+tree
implementation.

## Using

Just drop the "bgen.h" into your project and create your btree using the 
C preprocessor.

## Example 1 (Insert items)

Insert items into a simple btree that only stores ints.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define BGEN_NAME bt            // The namespace for the btree structure.
#define BGEN_TYPE int           // The data type for all items in the btree
#define BGEN_LESS return a < b; // A code fragment for comparing items
#include "../bgen.h"            // Include "bgen.h" to generate the btree

int main() {
    // Create an empty btree instance.
    struct bt *tree = 0;

    // Insert some items into the btree
    bt_insert(&tree, 3, 0, 0);
    bt_insert(&tree, 8, 0, 0);
    bt_insert(&tree, 2, 0, 0);
    bt_insert(&tree, 5, 0, 0);

    // Print items in tree
    struct bt_iter *iter;
    bt_iter_init(&tree, &iter, 0);
    for (bt_iter_scan(iter); bt_iter_valid(iter); bt_iter_next(iter)) {
        int item;
        bt_iter_item(iter, &item);
        printf("%d ", item);
    } 
    printf("\n");

    // Delete an item
    bt_delete(&tree, 3, 0, 0);

    // Print again
    for (bt_iter_scan(iter); bt_iter_valid(iter); bt_iter_next(iter)) {
        int item;
        bt_iter_item(iter, &item);
        printf("%d ", item);
    } 
    printf("\n");

    bt_iter_release(iter);
    bt_clear(&tree, 0);
    return 0;
}
// Output:
// 2 3 5 8
// 2 5 8
```

## Example 2 (Key-value map)

Create a key-value map where the key is a string and value is an int.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <assert.h>

struct pair {
    const char *key;
    int value;
};

#define BGEN_NAME map
#define BGEN_TYPE struct pair
#define BGEN_COMPARE return strcmp(a.key, b.key);
#include "../bgen.h"

void print_map(const char *comment, struct map **map) {
    printf("%s", comment);
    struct map_iter *iter;
    map_iter_init(map, &iter, 0);
    for (map_iter_scan(iter); map_iter_valid(iter); map_iter_next(iter)) {
        struct pair pair;
        map_iter_item(iter, &pair);
        printf("[%s] = %d; ", pair.key, pair.value);
    }
    map_iter_release(iter);
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    // Create a map of three (string, int) pairs
    struct map *map = 0;
    map_insert(&map, (struct pair){"GPU", 15}, 0, 0);
    map_insert(&map, (struct pair){"RAM", 20}, 0, 0);
    map_insert(&map, (struct pair){"CPU", 10}, 0, 0);
    print_map("1) Initial map:  ", &map);

    // Get an existing item
    struct pair item;
    assert(map_get(&map, (struct pair){"GPU"}, &item, 0) == map_FOUND);
    printf("2) Get item:     [%s] = %d;\n", item.key, item.value);

    // Update an existing item
    assert(map_insert(&map, (struct pair){"CPU", 25}, 0, 0) == map_REPLACED);
    // Insert a new item
    assert(map_insert(&map, (struct pair){"SSD", 30}, 0, 0) == map_INSERTED); 
    print_map("3) Updated map:  ", &map);
    assert(map_insert(&map, (struct pair){"UPS"}, 0, 0) == map_INSERTED); 
    print_map("4) Updated map:  ", &map);

    assert(map_delete(&map, (struct pair){.key="GPU"}, 0, 0) == map_DELETED);
    print_map("5) After delete: ", &map);

    return 0;
}

// Output:
// 1) Initial map:  [CPU] = 10; [GPU] = 15; [RAM] = 20;
// 2) Get item:     [GPU] = 15;
// 3) Updated map:  [CPU] = 25; [GPU] = 15; [RAM] = 20; [SSD] = 30;
// 4) Updated map:  [CPU] = 25; [GPU] = 15; [RAM] = 20; [SSD] = 30; [UPS] = 0;
// 5) After delete: [CPU] = 25; [RAM] = 20; [SSD] = 30; [UPS] = 0;
```

## Example 3 (Priority queue)

Create two [priority queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue).
One ordered by the maximum value and the other by the minimum value.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <assert.h>

#define BGEN_NAME max_priority_queue
#define BGEN_TYPE int
#define BGEN_LESS return a < b;
#include "../bgen.h"

#define BGEN_NAME min_priority_queue
#define BGEN_TYPE int
#define BGEN_LESS return b < a;
#include "../bgen.h"

int main() {
    int data[] = { 1, 8, 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 9, 7, 2 };
    int n = sizeof(data)/sizeof(int);
    printf("data: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", data[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    struct max_priority_queue *max_priority_queue = 0;

    // Fill the priority queue.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        max_priority_queue_insert(&max_priority_queue, data[i], 0, 0);
    }

    printf("max_priority_queue: ");
    while (max_priority_queue_count(&max_priority_queue, 0) > 0) {
        int val;
        max_priority_queue_pop_front(&max_priority_queue, &val, 0);
        printf("%d ", val);
    }
    printf("\n");

    struct min_priority_queue *min_priority_queue = 0;

    // Fill the priority queue.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        min_priority_queue_insert(&min_priority_queue, data[i], 0, 0);
    }

    printf("min_priority_queue: ");
    while (min_priority_queue_count(&min_priority_queue, 0) > 0) {
        int val;
        min_priority_queue_pop_front(&min_priority_queue, &val, 0);
        printf("%d ", val);
    }
    printf("\n");


    return 0;
}

// Output:
// data: 1 8 5 6 3 4 0 9 7 2
// max_priority_queue: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
// min_priority_queue: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
```

## Namespaces

Each bgen btree will have its own namespace using the `BGEN_NAME` define.

For example, the following will create a btree using the `users` namespace.

```c
#define BGEN_NAME users
#define BGEN_TYPE struct user
#define BGEN_LESS return a.id < b.id;
#include "bgen.h"
```

This will generate all the functions and types using the `users` prefix, such as:

```c
struct users; // The btree type
int users_get(struct users **root, struct user key, struct user *item, void *udata);
int users_insert(struct users **root, struct user item, struct user *old, void *udata);
int users_delete(struct users **root, struct user key, struct user *old, void *udata);
```

Many more functions will also be generated, see the [API](docs/API.md) for a complete list.

It's also possible to generate multiple btrees in the same source file.

```c
#define BGEN_NAME users
#define BGEN_TYPE struct user
#define BGEN_LESS return a.id < b.id;
#include "bgen.h"

#define BGEN_NAME orders
#define BGEN_TYPE struct order
#define BGEN_LESS return a.id < b.id;
#include "bgen.h"

#define BGEN_NAME events
#define BGEN_TYPE struct event
#define BGEN_LESS return a.id < b.id;
#include "bgen.h"
```

For the remainder of this README, and unless otherwise specified, the prefix
`bt` will be used as the namespace.

## Comparators

Every btree requires one comparator, which is a code fragment that compares two
items, using BGEN_LESS or BGEN_COMPARE. 

Bgen provides three variables to the code fragment `a`, `b`, and `udata`.
The `a` and `b` variables are the items that need to be compared, and `udata` is
optional [user data](#the-udata-parameter) that may be provided to any bgen
operation.

```c
#define BGEN_LESS    return a < b;               /* return true or false */
#define BGEN_COMPARE return a < b ? -1 : a > b;  /* return -1, 0, 1 */
```

It's up to the developer to choose which of the two is most appropriate. 
But in general, BGEN_LESS is a good choice for numeric comparisons and
BGEN_COMPARE may be better suited for strings and more complex keys. 

## Binary search or Linear search

Bgen defaults to linear searching. This means that btree operations will 
perform internal searches by scanning the items one-by-one. This is often very
cache-efficient, providing excellent performance for [small nodes](#fanout).

Optionally the BGEN_BSEARCH may be used to enable binary searches instead of
linear. This may be better for large nodes or where comparing items may be slow.

Note that bgen automatically enables [path hints](#path-hints) when the 
BGEN_BSEARCH option is provided.

## Less-equal hint

The BGEN_MAYBELESSEQUAL is a code fragment option that may be provided as an
optimization to speed up linear searches for complex comparisons.
More specifically for tuple-like items with composite keys, where the leading
field in the tuple is numeric and the other fields are indirect such as a
pointer to a string.

Bgen provides three variables to the code fragment `a`, `b`, and `udata`.

For example, let's say you have a btree index "status_users" btree that orders
on the composite key (status,name).

```c
struct status_user {
    int status;
    char *name;
    char *desc;
};

int user_compare(struct user a, struct user b) {
    return a.status < b.status ? -1 : a.status > b.status ? 1 : 
           strcmp(a.name, b.name);
}

#define BGEN_NAME            status_users
#define BGEN_TYPE            struct status_user
#define BGEN_COMPARE         return user_compare(a, b);
#define BGEN_MAYBELESSEQUAL  return a.status <= b.status;
#include "bgen.h"
```

With the BGEN_MAYBELESSEQUAL option, the btree will perform a quick linear
search on status and fallback to the slower user_compare function when needed.

Note that BGEN_MAYBELESSEQUAL is only for linear searches cannot be used in 
combination with BGEN_BSEARCH. 

## Copy-on-write

Bgen provides [copy-on-write](#copy-on-write) support when BGEN_COW is provided.
If enabled, the `bt_clone()` function can make an instant O(1) copy of the
btree.
This implementation uses atomic reference counters to monitor the shared state
of each node and preforms just-in-time copies of nodes for mutable operations,
such as `bt_insert()` and `bt_delete()`. 

The `BGEN_NOATOMIC` option may be provided to disable atomics, instead using
normal integers as reference counters. This may be needed for single-threaded
programs, embedded environments, or webassembly.

With BGEN_COW; while all mutable operations will perform copy-on-write
internally, immutable operations such as `bt_get()` will not.
It is possible to force the btree to perform copy-on-write for otherwise
immutable operations by using the their `_mut()` alternatives. 
For example, `bt_get() / bt_get_mut()` and 
`bt_iter_init() / bt_iter_init_mut()`. 

## Fanout

The fanout is the maximum number of children an internal btree node may have.
Bgen allows for setting the fanout using the BGEN_FANOUT option.
The default is 16.

Choosing the best fanout is dependent on a number of factors such as item size,
key types, and system architecture. 
In general, 8, 16, or 32 are typically pretty good choices.

## Custom allocators

The BGEN_MALLOC and BGEN_FREE can be used to provide a custom allocator for 
all btree operations. By default, the built-in `malloc()` and `free()`
functions from `<stdlib.h>` are used. 

BGEN_MALLOC provides the `size` and `udata` variables.  
BGEN_FREE provides the `ptr`, the original `size`, and `udata` variables.

```c
#define BGEN_MALLOC return mymalloc(size);
#define BGEN_FREE   myfree(ptr);
```

Bgen is designed for graceful error handling when malloc fails.
All mutable btree operations such as `bt_insert()` may fail when attempting to
allocate memory. It's generally a good idea to check for the `bt_NOMEM` 
[status code](#status-codes). 

## Item copying and freeing

When the `bt_copy()`, `bt_clone()`, and `bt_clear()` functions are 
used, the btree will internally copy and free nodes. 
With BGEN_ITEMFREE and BGEN_ITEMCOPY, it's possible to also have the btree copy 
and free items.

This may be needed when items have internal memory allocations, such as strings
or other heap-based fields, that require isolation per btree instance and to
avoid memory corruptions such as double free errors.

BGEN_ITEMCOPY provides the `item`, `copy`, and `udata` variables.
BGEN_ITEMFREE provides the `item` and `udata` variables.

For example:

```c
struct user {
    int id;
    char *name;
};

bool copy_user(struct user item, struct user *copy) {
    copy->name = malloc(strlen(item.name)+1);
    if (!copy->name) {
        return false;
    }
    strcpy(copy->name, item.name);
    copy->id = item->id;
    return true;
}

void free_user(struct user item) {
    free(item.name);
}

#define BGEN_NAME users
#define BGEN_TYPE struct user
#define BGEN_LESS a.id < b.id
#define BGEN_ITEMCOPY return copy_user(item, copy);
#define BGEN_ITEMFREE free_user(item);
#include "bgen.h"
```

Now when `users_clear()` is called all items will also be freed with 
`free_user()`, and when `users_clone()` or `users_copy()` are called items will
automatically be copied with `copy_user()`.

The BGEN_ITEMCOPY expects a return value of `true` or `false`, where `false`
means that there was an error such as out of memory. 

## Path hints

Bgen uses path hints when BGEN_BSEARCH is provided.
It's an automatic search optimization which causes the btree to track the
search path of every operation, using that path as a hint for the next
operation.

It can lead to better performance for common access patterns, where subsequent 
operations work on items that are typically nearby each other in the btree.

For more information see the 
[original document](https://github.com/tidwall/btree/blob/master/PATH_HINT.md).

This implementation uses a thread-local variable to manage the hint.
Other than providing BGEN_BSEARCH, there are no additional requirements to make
this feature work.

To disable path hints, provide the BGEN_NOHINTS option.

## Iterators

Iteration comes in two flavors, callback and loop-based. 

Callback iteration requires a callback function that will be called for each
item in the iteration. 

For example, let's say you have a `users` btree that orders users on
(last,first).

```c
struct user {
    char *last;
    char *first;
    int age;
};

int user_compare(struct user a, struct user b) {
    int cmp = strcmp(a.last, b.last);
    if (cmp == 0) {
        cmp = strcmp(a.first, b.first);
    }
    return cmp;
}

bool user_iter(struct user user, void *udata) {
    printf("%s %s (age=%d)\n", user.first, user.last, user.age);
    return true;
}

#define BGEN_NAME users
#define BGEN_TYPE struct user
#define BGEN_COMPARE { return user_compare(a, b); }
#include "../bgen.h"
```

Callback iterators such as `bt_scan()` and `bt_seek()` are available.

```c
bt_scan(&tree, user_iter, 0);
```

Loop iteration allows for keeping the iterator from leaving the current 
function. It takes a little more work to set up but is sometimes easier t
manage the context of operation.

```c
struct users_iter *iter;
users_iter_init(&users, &iter, 0);
users_iter_scan(iter);
while (users_iter_valid(iter)) {
    users_iter_item(iter, &user);
    printf("%s %s (age=%d)\n", user.first, user.last, user.age);
    users_iter_next(iter);
}
users_iter_release(iter);
```

It's usually not safe to modify the btree while iterating. 
If you need to filter data then it's best to reset the iterator after
each modification.

```c
struct users_iter *iter;
users_iter_init(&users, &iter, 0);
users_iter_scan(iter);
while (users_iter_valid(iter)) {
    users_iter_item(iter, &user);
    if (user.age >= 30 && user.age < 40) {
        users_delete(&users, user, 0, 0);
        users_iter_seek(iter, user);
        continue;
    } 
    users_iter_next(iter);
}
users_iter_release(iter);
```

Make sure to call `bt_iter_release()` when you are done iterating;

## Status codes 

Most btree operations, such as `bt_get()` and `bt_insert()` return status
codes that indicate the success of the operation. All status codes are prefixed
with the same namespace as specified with BGEN_NAME. 

| Status         | Description |
| :------------- | :--- |
| bt_INSERTED    | New item was inserted |
| bt_REPLACED    | Item replaced an existing item |
| bt_DELETED     | Item was successfully deleted |
| bt_FOUND       | Item was successfully found |
| bt_NOTFOUND    | Item was not found |
| bt_OUTOFORDER  | Item cannot be inserted due to out of order |
| bt_FINISHED    | Callback iterator returned all items |
| bt_STOPPED     | Callback iterator was stopped early |
| bt_COPIED      | Tree was copied: `bt_clone()`, `bt_copy()` |
| bt_NOMEM       | Out of memory error |
| bt_UNSUPPORTED | Operation not supported |

It's always a good idea to check the return value of mutable btree operations to 
ensure it doesn't return an error.

## The udata parameter

All bgen functions provide an optional `udata` parameter that may be used for
user-defined data. What this data is used for is up to the developer.

All operations, callbacks, and code fragments (such as BGEN_COMPARE and 
BGEN_LESS) provide a `udata` variable that is the same as what is passed to 
original btree function.

## Counted B-tree

A [counted btree](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/algorithms/cbtree.html) 
allows for random access and modifications with O(log n) complexity.

Adding the BGEN_COUNTED option enables this feature.

This is pretty nice for programs that need to make changes using an index, 
rather than a key. It basically allows for functions like `bt_insert_at()`, 
`bt_delete_at()`, and `bt_get_at()` to modify and access items at any position.

But it's worth noting that the `bt_insert_at()` operation still requires that
items inserted at specific positions are in the correct order.
The `bt_OUTOFORDER` error will be returned otherwise.

## Vector B-tree

When the BGEN_COUNTED and BGEN_NOORDER options are both provided, bgen will
generate a specialized btree that allows for both random access and storing
items in any order.
This effectively treats the btree like a dynamic array, aka a vector.

Those familiar with vectors in other languages, such a Rust and C++, may know 
that appending and accessing items is fast but modifying is slow.

With a bgen vector all operations have the same
[time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).

| Operation  | Bgen     | Others       |
| :--------  | :------- | :----------- |
| push_back  | O(log n) | O(1)         |
| pop_back   | O(log n) | O(1)         |
| get_at     | O(log n) | O(1)         |
| push_front | O(log n) | O(n)         |
| pop_front  | O(log n) | O(n)         |
| insert_at  | O(log n) | O(n)         |
| delete_at  | O(log n) | O(n)         |

Here's how to create a vector that stores ints.

```c
#define BGEN_NAME vector
#define BGEN_TYPE int
#define BGEN_COUNTED
#define BGEN_NOORDER
#include "../bgen.h"
```

Now `vector_insert_at()`, `vector_delete_at()`, and `vector_get_at()` can be
used to modify and access items at any position, in any order. 

For a more detailed example, check out the [examples](examples) directory.

## Spatial B-tree

A [spatial btree](docs/SPATIAL_BTREE.md) allows for working with
multidimensional data.

Adding the BGEN_SPATIAL option enables this feature.

Additionally, the BGEN_ITEMRECT needs to be provided, which is responsible 
for filling the 'min' and 'max' rectangle (bounding box) for each item.
This rectangle is used by the btree for efficient spatial searching.

```c
void point_rect(struct point point, double min[], double max[]) {
    min[0] = point.x;
    min[1] = point.y;
    max[0] = point.x;
    max[1] = point.y;
}

#define BGEN_NAME spatial
#define BGEN_TYPE struct point
#define BGEN_SPATIAL
#define BGEN_ITEMRECT return point_rect(item, min, max);
#define BGEN_COMPARE return point_compare(a, b);
#include "../bgen.h"
```

By default, a spatial btree is two dimensions and uses `double` as the rectangle
coordinate type.

These can be changed using BGEN_DIMS and BGEN_RTYPE.

```c
#define BGEN_DIMS  3         // use three dimensions instead of two
#define BGEN_RTYPE uint32_t  // use uint32_t instead of double 
```

Once enabled you can use the `bt_intersects` and `bt_nearby` iterators to 
efficiently searching intersecting rectangles and the performing the nearest 
neighbors operation ([kNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)).

See the [spatial.c](examples/spatial.c) example from the [examples directory](examples).

## Header and source

By default, bgen generates all the code as a static unit for the current source
file that includes "bgen.h".

This is great if all you need to access the btree from that one file.
But if you want other c source files to access those same btree functions too
then you'll use the `BGEN_HEADER` and `BGEN_SOURCE` options.

For example, here we'll create a "users.h" and "users.c" where one generates
only the header declarations and the other generates the code.

```c
// users.h
#ifndef USERS_H
#define USERS_H

struct user {
    int id;
    char *name;
};

#define BGEN_NAME users
#define BGEN_TYPE struct user
#define BGEN_HEADER
#include "../deps/bgen.h"

#endif
```

```c
// users.c
#include "users.h"

#define BGEN_NAME users
#define BGEN_TYPE struct user
#define BGEN_LESS return a.id < b.id;
#define BGEN_SOURCE
#include "../deps/bgen.h"
```


## Performance

The following benchmarks compare the performance of bgen to the very fast
[frozenca/btree](https://github.com/frozenca/BTree) for C++ and the built-in
Rust B-tree.

Also compared is the bgen spatial btree vs a standard r-tree with data inserted
in hilbert order.
